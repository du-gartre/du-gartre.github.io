    "text": "My name is David, and I’m currently working towards a Ph.D.in Epidemiology at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health (SEPH) of the University of Ottawa.\nI’m part of the Decision Analysis, Simulation and Health Economics Lab (DASH Lab), as well as the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup, the latter through which I’ve provided courses on cost-effectiveness and decision modeling using R.\nCurrently, I specialize in building statistical models to simulate diseases and their outcomes among populations to evaluate hypothetical health policies using health economic evaluation tools.\nMy goal is to support the shaping, improvement, and evaluation of health policies.\nOutside of research, I dance Lindy Hop, play the guitar (to the dismay of my roommate), and I’m part of the uOttawa rowing team. I am originally from México (lindo y querido), however I am currently in Ottawa, Canada.\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email"

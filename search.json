In the latter group, I have provided courses on cost-effectiveness and decision modeling using R.\nCurrently, I specialize in building statistical models to simulate diseases among populations and use their outcomes to evaluate hypothetical health policies applying health economic evaluation tools. My goal is to support shaping, improving, and evaluating health policies.\nBesides research, I dance Lindy Hop and sometimes play the guitar. I am currently training with the uOttawa rowing team. I come from Mexico (lindo y querido), however, I am currently in Ottawa, Canada.\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email"
